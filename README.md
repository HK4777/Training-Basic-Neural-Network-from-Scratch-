# Training Basic Neural Network from scratch
Notebook for training a basic neural network without the use of any deep learning libraries.

## Goal
The goal of this notebook is to  predict the correct output value when provided with a new set of data.

This project addresses the following:

#### Functions-
- The notebook defines a neural net Class function including helper functions (sigmoid and sigmoid derivative functions). 
#### Matrix Operations-
- Multiplication of the matrix has been done after transposing the matrix from horizontal position to vertical position.

## Findings:
- The neural net can successfully predict outcome new set of data
